### about

i'm a computer science student at ucll (belgium) with a focus on ai & data science. i build full-stack applications with ai integrated end-to-end from data pipelines to inference to user-facing interfaces.

with 3–5 years of hands-on experience across production-style projects, my core strength is shipping usable, maintainable systems where machine learning is a first-class citizen rather than an afterthought.

### current focus

- applied ai systems: llms, retrieval-augmented generation, fine-tuning
- data engineering and pipeline architecture
- classical machine learning for real-world problems
- full-stack applications with ai woven throughout
- building systems that are maintainable before they're clever

### mindset

> clarity, scalability, and intention are the only metrics that matter. i treat software as a medium for reasoning — not just output.
